# Open Source UoM

Welcome to the Open Source UoM organization! We are dedicated to promoting and advocating for Open Source Software within the University of Macedonia community and beyond.

## About Us

The Open Source Software Community of the University of Macedonia is a group organized by students of the University, aiming to raise awareness and promote Open Source Software, Open Source Hardware, and Free Software. Our team mainly consists of students from the Department of Applied Informatics, but we welcome anyone interested in contributing to our cause in any way they can.

Participation in our activities is voluntary, and there is no obligation to contribute financially unless you choose to support the team in covering occasional expenses, such as purchasing necessary equipment or organizing events.

For more information, feel free to reach out to us via email at opensource@uom.edu.gr.
